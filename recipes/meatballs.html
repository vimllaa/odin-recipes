<h2>Swedish Meatballs Recipe</h2>
<p>
  Swedish meatballs, or köttbullar, must be prepared, above all, with love. This
  is why homemade meatballs are a widespread concept in Sweden, and there are
  many different favourite recipes – with and without meat
</p>
<ul>
  <li>500 g (18 oz) ground (minced) beef/pork mixture</li>
  <li>150 ml (4/5 cup) milk</li>
  <li>75 g (¾ cup) white breadcrumbs</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>1 onion</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>Ground allspice</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    Finely dice the onion and sauté gently in a little butter without browning.
    Soak the breadcrumbs in milk
  </li>
  <li>
    Blend the ground meat, preferably in a food processor, with the onion, egg,
    milk–breadcrumb mixture and the spices to the proper consistency and taste.
  </li>
  <li>Add a little water if the mixture feels too firm.</li>
  <li>
    Check the taste by test-frying one meatball. Then shape small meatballs with
    the aid of two spoons and place on water-rinsed plates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Brown a generous pat of butter in a frying pan, and when it ‘goes quiet’
    place the meatballs in the pan and let them brown on all sides. Shake the
    frying pan often.
  </li>
</ol>
